I am currently a PhD student in Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences at HKUST(GZ), under the supervision of Prof. Li. My research focuses on ocean surface boundary layer mixing and its submesoscale roles. Prior to joining this group, I earned a Master's degree in Fluid Machinery and Engineering from the School of Energy and Power Engineering at Xi'an Jiaotong University, where I worked with Prof. Jiazhong Zhang on studying the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers in supersonic flow. Additionally, I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Energy and Power Engineering from the same institution.
