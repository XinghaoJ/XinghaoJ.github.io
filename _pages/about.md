I am currently a PhD student in [Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (EOAS)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/function-hub/earth-ocean-and-atmospheric-sciences) at [HKUST(GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Li](https://qingli411.github.io/). My research focuses on ocean surface boundary layer mixing and its submesoscale roles. Prior to joining this group, I earned a Master's degree in Fluid Machinery and Engineering from the [School of Energy and Power Engineering](http://epe.xjtu.edu.cn/home.htm) at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/), where I worked with [Prof. Jiazhong Zhang](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/jzzhang) on studying the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers in supersonic flow. Additionally, I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Energy and Power Engineering from the same institution.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/sl-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
